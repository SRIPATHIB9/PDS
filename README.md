Question 2:

The five visualizations significantly enhance data analysis. The Math Score Distribution (Histogram) helps identify the overall spread, skewness, and outliers in math scores, assisting in detecting struggling students. The Gender vs. Average Scores (Bar Chart) reveals performance differences between male and female students across subjects, enabling targeted learning strategies. The Parental Education Level vs. Math Scores (Box Plot) highlights the influence of parental education on student performance, guiding policymakers in addressing educational inequalities. The Test Preparation Course vs. Math Scores (Violin Plot) visualizes the effectiveness of test preparation courses, showing whether students who took the course performed better. Finally, the Correlation Heatmap of Scores helps understand relationships between different subjects, showing strong correlations such as between reading and writing, which can aid in designing interdisciplinary teaching strategies.
